TODO: Explain folder structure, how to build, etc.

Some Gotchas
------------

We put an azure/__init__.py in every package even though we don't want to distribute one.
This is so that PTVS can analyze the package and provide IntelliSense when developing the tests.
Add an exclude in MANIFEST.in so that the azure/__init__.py doesn't get included from the source distribution when 'python.exe setup.py sdist'.
Note that 'python.exe setup.py bdist_wheel' will ignore the exclusion and you'll have an azure/__init__.py in your .whl.
To get around that, build the wheel from the source distribution with 'pip.exe wheel <source>.zip'.
Add every top package folder to the search path for PTVS analysis and running tests.
Make sure to save setup.py as UTF-8 WITHOUT BOM, otherwise you'll get an error with no details: 'Failed building wheel for X'.
